# Tuning Parallel HDF5 I/O Performance on Summit

This repository has source codes and scripts to reproduce the experiments for benchmarking parallel HDF5 I/O performance.

The code has been tested on Summit and Cori supercomputers, and requrires a parallel HDF5 library installation (`module load hdf5`) to compile.
